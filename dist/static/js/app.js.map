Lorem Ipsum has been the\\n      industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and\\n      scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into\\n      electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of\\n      Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus\\n      PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\\n    </p>\\n  </aui-tab>\\n</aui-tabs>\\n\"\n\t    };\n\t  }\n\t};\n\n/***/ },\n/* 35 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\texports = module.exports = __webpack_require__(2)();\n\t// imports\n\t\n\t\n\t// module\n\texports.push([module.id, \"\", \"\", {\"version\":3,\"sources\":[],\"names\":[],\"mappings\":\"\",\"file\":\"App.vue\",\"sourceRoot\":\"webpack://\"}]);\n\t\n\t// exports\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 36 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\texports = module.exports = __webpack_require__(2)();\n\t// imports\n\t\n\t\n\t// module\n\texports.push([module.id, \".custom-class[data-v-73a3dc3e]{width:300px}\", \"\", {\"version\":3,\"sources\":[\"/./src/docs/component/Selects.vue\"],\"names\":[],\"mappings\":\"AACA,+BACE,WAAa,CACd\",\"file\":\"Selects.vue\",\"sourcesContent\":[\"\\n.custom-class[data-v-73a3dc3e] {\\n  width: 300px;\\n}\\n\"],\"sourceRoot\":\"webpack://\"}]);\n\t\n\t// exports\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 37 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\texports = module.exports = __webpack_require__(2)();\n\t// imports\n\t\n\t\n\t// module\n\texports.push([module.id, \"code{border:1px solid #ccc;border-radius:3px}.aui-tabs,.tabs-pane{padding-top:10px}\", \"\", {\"version\":3,\"sources\":[\"/./src/main.css\"],\"names\":[],\"mappings\":\"AAAA,KACE,sBAAuB,AACvB,iBAAmB,CACpB,AAMD,qBACE,gBAAkB,CACnB\",\"file\":\"main.css\",\"sourcesContent\":[\"code {\\n  border: 1px #ccc solid;\\n  border-radius: 3px;\\n}\\n\\n.tabs-pane {\\n  padding-top: 10px;\\n}\\n\\n.aui-tabs {\\n  padding-top: 10px;\\n}\\n\"],\"sourceRoot\":\"webpack://\"}]);\n\t\n\t// exports\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 38 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t/*\n\tSyntax highlighting with language autodetection.\n\thttps://highlightjs.org/\n\t*/\n\t\n\t(function(factory) {\n\t\n\t  // Find the global object for export to both the browser and web workers.\n\t  var globalObject = typeof window === 'object' && window ||\n\t                     typeof self === 'object' && self;\n\t\n\t  // Setup highlight.js for different environments.
